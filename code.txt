#testing git on command line 
git init to initialize a dir 
git add <fname> to add to repo
git commit to stage the file
git status gives the status of the repo


git diff gives the changed from commited file to present file.
Need to add a file everytime before commit . 

Once you git add , its staged . To check the diff between the staged and last commit file : git dif --staged 

INIT -> ADD -> COMMIt : initialize -> add to repo ( staged ) -> commit the changes
